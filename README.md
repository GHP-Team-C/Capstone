# augmentEd

## Setup

- npm install
- createdb capstone
- npm run start:dev:seed

The server will run on localhost:8080. The database has two pre-made users (cody (pw: 123) and murphy (pw: 123))! One of them will have created lessons assigned to him.

Have fun, click things, try to break it!

We are aware that the current pagination in the edit view covers some of the edit buttons and can be hard to use! It is in the process of being fixed. If you wish to access the buttons more easily, you can resize the page.
