  {
    text: "The Clef: \n\nOn the Musical Staff all the way to the left is an extravagant curly symbol representing which clef we are using. \n\nA clef is a specific range of notes, or pitches. \n\nIn these lessons, we'll stick with the treble clef - but there are others! (The bass clef, for instance, covers notes below the treble clef)",
  },
  {
    text: "The Time Signature: \n\nThe two number 4s stacked on top of one another denote the time signature. \n\nThe bottom number represents the subdivision - in this case it's a '4' so we're looking at Quarter notes. \n\nThe Top number represents how many of these subdivisions make a complete measure - in this case it's another 4, so this means 4 Quarter notes make a complete measure. \n\nFor simplicity's sake we'll keep this the same - but it can change too!",
  },
  {
    text: "Notes and Rests: \n\nA note represents a sound that is to be played on a musical staff. In these lessons, the notes are all Quarter notes, representing 1/4 of the time of the measure (the whole container, or bar). \n\nQuarter notes are solid, and have a plain vertical bar or 'flag.' \n\nWhere the note is positioned determines its pitch, or how high or low the note should sound.\n\nA rest represents a pause with no sound. In these lessons, the rests are all Quarter rests, and look like a cute little squiggle.",
  },
  {
    text: "Chords: \n\nA stack of notes on top of each other is called a Chord - and tells the person playing the music to play all these notes at the same time. \n\nIn these lessons, we'll stick to 3-note chords, called Triads. \n\nIn more advanced music, you will encounter other kinds of chords as well - but we'll save that for later!",

  {
    text: "In 'Getting Started' you learned that the position of the notes determines the pitch...\n\n but which is which?!\n\nLuckily, there are two catchy ways to remmber the notes on the lines, and the notes on the spaces (next slide)",

    text: "'Every Girl Boss Deserves Fame' (or 'Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge')\n\nThis stands for the Lines of the treble clef. Starting from the bottom, the notes are E G B D F! (next slide)",

    text: "What about the spaces? Easy! Those ones are FACE! \n\n From the bottom up, F A C E. FACE! (next slide)",
  },
  {
    text: "So then what about the notes outside of the lines?! \n\nA good practice for beginners is to start with the closest note that you DO know, and work your way one step at a time \n\n One step = one letter of the alphabet = from a line to the next space, or a space to the next line (next slide)",

  },
  {
    text: "Scales are sequences of notes that move up or down one musical 'step' at a time. \n\n A step can be either a half-step or a whole step. \n\nTo understand better, look at the piano - two keys right next to each other like E and F are a half-step. Two keys with one key in between like C and D (with the black key between) are a whole step (next slide)",
  },
  {
    text: "The most common scale is called the Major scale, and in the key of C (the key we are in now, with no sharps or flats) the first note is...\n\nyou guessed it - C! \n\nFrom here, we move up one letter of the alphabet at a time - C D E F... (next slide)",
  },
  {
    text: "...G A B, and back to C again at the top! The sequence of half-steps and whole steps of a Major scale in any key is: \n\nWhole, Whole, Half, Whole, Whole, Whole, Half (next slide)",
