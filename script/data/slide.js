    text: 'The Clef: \n\nOn the Musical Staff all the way to the left is an extravagant curly symbol representing which clef we are using. \n\nA clef is a specific range of notes, or pitches. \n\nIn these lessons, we\'ll stick with the treble clef - but there are others! (The bass clef, for instance, covers notes below the treble clef)',

  {
    text: 'The Time Signature: \n\nThe two number 4s stacked on top of one another denote the time signature. \n\nThe bottom number represents the subdivision - in this case it\'s a \'4\' so we\'re looking at Quarter notes. \n\nThe Top number represents how many of these subdivisions make a complete measure - in this case it\'s another 4, so this means 4 Quarter notes make a complete measure. \n\nFor simplicity\'s sake we\'ll keep this the same - but it can change too!',

    text: 'Notes and Rests: \n\nA note represents a sound that is to be played on a musical staff. In these lessons, the notes are all Quarter notes, representing 1/4 of the time of the measure (the whole container, or bar). \n\nQuarter notes are solid, and have a plain vertical bar or \'flag.\' \n\nWhere the note is positioned determines its pitch, or how high or low the note should sound.\n\nA rest represents a pause with no sound. In these lessons, the rests are all Quarter rests, and look like a cute little squiggle.',

  //Lesson 1, slide 5:
  {
    text: 'Chords: \n\nA stack of notes on top of each other is called a Chord - and tells the person playing the music to play all these notes at the same time. \n\nIn these lessons, we\'ll stick to 3-note chords, called Triads. \n\nIn more advanced music, you will encounter other kinds of chords as well - but we\'ll save that for later!',
