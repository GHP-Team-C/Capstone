First time here? Take a look around at these tools!

1. This is a Staff - a common form of notation to display musical notes. Click on a note to hear the sound!
2. The Piano Display shows the notes that are selected on the Staff - Click a different note on the staff to see the keyboard change!
3. The Player Piano on the top of the screen allows you to practice if you don't have a piano at home. Keys A S D F G H J K L on your keyboard will play the notes C D E F G A B C D on the piano - try plucking out a tune!
